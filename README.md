# My First C++ Project

This project demonstrates the creation of a simple C++ project with functions in separate files and a Makefile for compilation and cleanup.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `foo.cpp`: Contains the implementation of `foo()` function.
- `bar.cpp`: Contains the implementation of `bar()` function.
- `main.cpp`: Contains the `main()` function which calls `foo()` and `bar()`.
- `Makefile`: Used to compile and clean the project.
